Saplings can be harvested by any toll.

You'll get them from punishing Leaves or the more efficient way to,

harvest the Wood Logs. You'll notice the the Leaves vile disappear 

and the Saplings will fall to the ground.

If you want to speed up the Grow progress 

you can use Bone Meal on the Sapling.
Note: It will not Grow instantly you will nit 3-5 Bone Meal.
